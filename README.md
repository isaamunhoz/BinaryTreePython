## Description
This is a Python implementation of a binary tree data structure.

## Installation

- First clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaamunhoz/BinaryTreePython
```
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```bash
cd BinaryTreePython
```

```
- Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the required dependencies using pip:

## Usage

- You can use this library to create and manipulate binary trees in your Python projects.
- To use this library, you need to import it into your Python project using the following code:
```python
from BynarySearchTree import BynarySearchTree
```
- To create a new binary search tree, you can use the `BinarySearchTree` class constructor:
```python
bst = BynarySearchTree()
```
- You can also check by runinig the tests or by running the examples on 'main.py'.

- You can run the tests using the following command:
```bash
pytest test_binary_search_tree.py
```
